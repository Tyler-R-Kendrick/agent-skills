# Dynamic Programming

Use when solving optimization problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Covers memoization (top-down) vs tabulation (bottom-up), classic DP problems (Knapsack, LCS, LIS, Edit Distance, Coin Change, Matrix Chain, Rod Cutting), and the DP framework. Based on Knuth's TAOCP.
