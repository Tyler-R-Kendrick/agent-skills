# Development Fundamentals

## Overview
This skill covers the foundational knowledge every software developer should command — drawn from canonical published works and industry-proven practices. It spans from low-level algorithms through code craftsmanship to system-level architecture.

## Choosing the Right Pattern Category

| Problem | Look In |
|---------|---------|
| Object creation complexity | Design Patterns → Creational |
| Composing objects / adapting interfaces | Design Patterns → Structural |
| Object communication / state management | Design Patterns → Behavioral |
| Service-to-service messaging | Integration Patterns |
| Algorithm selection / optimization | Algorithms |
| Code readability and maintainability | Craftsmanship |
| System decomposition and boundaries | Architecture |
| Client-side application structure | Frontend |
| Server-side data and API structure | Backend |

## Best Practices
- Learn patterns as a vocabulary, not a checklist — apply them when the problem calls for it, not preemptively.
- Start with the simplest architecture that works (monolith), evolve toward complexity (microservices) only when you have evidence you need it.
- Apply the Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it, every time you touch it.
- Use SOLID principles as guardrails for daily decisions, not just for greenfield design.
- Prefer composition over inheritance — most GoF patterns are variations of this principle.
- Study algorithms for problem-solving intuition, not memorization — know when to reach for a graph algorithm vs. dynamic programming.
- Keep integration patterns in mind whenever systems need to communicate — messaging solves problems that synchronous calls create.
