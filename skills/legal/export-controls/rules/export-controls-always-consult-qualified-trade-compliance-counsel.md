## Always consult qualified trade compliance counsel.

Export control violations carry severe criminal penalties, including imprisonment up to 20 years and fines up to $1 million per violation under ITAR, and up to $300,000 per violation or twice the transaction value under EAR. Do not attempt to self-assess complex export control questions.
