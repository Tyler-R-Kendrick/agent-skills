# Security Logging & Monitoring

## Overview

OWASP A09:2021 — Security Logging and Monitoring Failures — highlights the critical importance of comprehensive logging and active monitoring in application security. Without adequate logging, breaches go undetected; without effective monitoring, alerts go unnoticed. Security logging is the foundation of incident detection and forensics. On average, organizations take over 200 days to detect a breach, and insufficient logging is a primary contributing factor. Every security-relevant event must be captured, stored securely, and analyzed in near real time to enable rapid detection, investigation, and response.

## What to Log

Every application must log security-relevant events with enough detail to support forensic investigation and compliance audits.

| Event Category | Examples | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication events | Login, logout, failed login attempts, password changes, MFA enrollment/bypass | Critical |
| Authorization failures | Access denied, privilege escalation attempts, role changes | Critical |
| Data access | PII read/write/delete, bulk data exports, sensitive record access | High |
| Configuration changes | System settings modifications, feature flag changes, security policy updates | High |
| Administrative actions | User creation/deletion, role assignments, permission grants, system restarts | High |
| Input validation failures | Rejected input, SQL injection attempts, XSS payloads, malformed requests | Medium |
| Application errors | Unhandled exceptions, stack traces, crash reports, resource exhaustion | Medium |
| API usage | Rate limit hits, deprecated endpoint calls, unusual request patterns, quota exhaustion | Medium |

**Critical events** must trigger immediate alerts. **High-priority events** should be reviewed within hours. **Medium-priority events** should be included in daily or weekly reviews.

## Audit Trail Requirements

A complete audit trail answers five fundamental questions for every security-relevant action:

- **Who** — The authenticated identity that performed the action (user ID, service account, API key identifier).
- **What** — The specific action taken (created, read, updated, deleted, configured, approved).
- **When** — The precise timestamp in UTC with millisecond precision (ISO 8601 format).
- **Where** — The source IP address, device identifier, geographic location (if available), and the system or endpoint acted upon.
- **Outcome** — Whether the action succeeded or failed, including the reason for failure (e.g., "access denied: insufficient permissions").

### Tamper Protection

Audit logs must be protected against modification or deletion by the systems and people they are designed to monitor.

- **Immutable logs** — Write logs to append-only storage such as write-once, read-many (WORM) storage, or immutable cloud storage buckets (e.g., S3 Object Lock, Azure Immutable Blob Storage).
- **Cryptographic signing** — Sign log entries or batches using HMAC or digital signatures to detect any post-hoc modification. Chain signatures (hash chaining) to detect deletions or reordering.
- **Separate storage** — Store security logs in a dedicated system with independent access controls, isolated from the application and its administrators.
- **Integrity verification** — Regularly verify log integrity by validating cryptographic signatures and checking for gaps in sequence numbers or timestamps.

## SIEM Architecture

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems aggregate, normalize, correlate, and analyze security events from across the organization. A well-architected SIEM pipeline follows this flow:

```
Collection --> Normalization --> Correlation --> Alerting --> Reporting
     |              |               |              |             |
  Log agents    Parse and      Match events    Notify SOC    Dashboards,
  Syslog        enrich with    against rules   via PagerDuty compliance
  API ingestion common schema  and baselines   Slack, email  audit reports
```

1. **Collection** — Gather logs from all sources: applications, infrastructure, cloud services, endpoints, network devices. Use agents, syslog forwarding, or API-based ingestion.
2. **Normalization** — Parse raw logs into a common schema (e.g., Elastic Common Schema, OCSF). Enrich events with contextual data such as geolocation, threat intelligence, and asset inventory.
3. **Correlation** — Apply detection rules, statistical baselines, and behavioral analytics to identify patterns indicative of attacks. Correlate events across multiple sources to detect multi-stage attacks.
4. **Alerting** — Route alerts to the appropriate team based on severity and type. Integrate with incident management tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, ServiceNow). Minimize false positives through tuning.
5. **Reporting** — Generate dashboards for real-time visibility and compliance reports for auditors. Track metrics such as mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR).

### SIEM Tools

| Tool | Type | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Splunk | Commercial | Enterprise-scale deployments with advanced analytics and extensive integrations |
| Elastic SIEM | Open-source core | Cost-effective deployments leveraging the Elastic Stack (ELK) with detection rules |
| Microsoft Sentinel | Cloud-native | Azure-centric environments with native Microsoft 365 and Azure integration |
| Sumo Logic | SaaS | Multi-cloud environments requiring a fully managed, cloud-native solution |
| Wazuh | Open-source | Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS) combined with SIEM, file integrity monitoring |

## Compliance Requirements

Different regulatory frameworks impose specific requirements on security logging and monitoring. Failing to meet these requirements can result in significant fines and legal liability.

| Standard | Logging Requirement |
|---|---|
| PCI DSS | Centralized log collection and retention for a minimum of 1 year (3 months immediately available); daily log review; monitoring of all access to cardholder data environments |
| GDPR | Audit trail of all personal data processing activities; breach detection capabilities with 72-hour notification requirement; data subject access request logging |
| HIPAA | Access logs for all systems containing Protected Health Information (PHI); 6-year minimum log retention; monitoring of access patterns for unauthorized disclosure |
| SOX | Financial system audit trails demonstrating integrity of financial reporting; tamper-proof logs; segregation of duties verification through log analysis |

## Log Security

Security logs are themselves a high-value target. If an attacker can modify or delete logs, they can cover their tracks and extend the dwell time of a breach.

- **Protect logs from tampering** — Use append-only storage, cryptographic signing, and hash chaining to ensure log integrity.
- **Separate log storage** — Store security logs on dedicated infrastructure with independent authentication and access controls. Application administrators should not have write or delete access to security logs.
- **Encrypt log transport** — Use TLS for all log shipping. Encrypt logs at rest using AES-256-GCM or equivalent.
- **Restrict log access** — Apply the principle of least privilege. Only security operations and compliance personnel should have read access to security logs. Log all access to the logs themselves (meta-auditing).
- **Retention policies** — Define retention periods based on compliance requirements and organizational needs. Automate log lifecycle management to ensure logs are retained for the required duration and securely deleted afterward.

## Best Practices

- **Log all security-relevant events** at the application layer, not just at the infrastructure layer; application context (user identity, business action, data sensitivity) is essential for meaningful detection.
- **Use structured logging formats** (JSON, key-value pairs) with a consistent schema across all services to enable reliable parsing, searching, and correlation in your SIEM.
- **Include correlation identifiers** (request ID, trace ID, session ID) in every log entry to enable end-to-end tracing of a single request or user session across distributed services.
- **Never log sensitive data** such as passwords, tokens, credit card numbers, or PII in cleartext; mask or redact sensitive fields before writing to the log.
- **Set up real-time alerting** for critical security events (authentication failures exceeding a threshold, privilege escalation, data exfiltration patterns) with clearly defined escalation paths.
- **Regularly test your detection capabilities** by running tabletop exercises, purple team engagements, and SIEM detection rule testing to ensure alerts fire correctly and are actionable.
- **Monitor the monitoring** — alert on gaps in log ingestion (silent sources), SIEM processing delays, and storage capacity thresholds to ensure your logging pipeline remains healthy.
- **Review and tune detection rules quarterly** to reduce false positives, adapt to evolving threats, and incorporate lessons learned from incidents and near-misses.
