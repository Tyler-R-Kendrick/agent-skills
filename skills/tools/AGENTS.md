# Developer Tools

## Overview

These are the tools every developer needs regardless of language or framework — the bedrock of the development environment. Whether you are writing Python, C#, Rust, or JavaScript, you will reach for these tools daily: a shell to run commands, Git to track changes, a package manager to install software, and containers to ship reproducible environments. Mastering this foundational layer makes everything built on top of it faster and more reliable.

## Best Practices

- **Automate your setup with dotfiles.** Keep your shell configuration, Git config, and tool settings in a version-controlled dotfiles repository so you can bootstrap any new machine in minutes.
- **Use cross-platform tools where possible.** Prefer tools like PowerShell Core, Docker, and Git that work identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux to reduce friction when switching environments or collaborating across teams.
- **Learn at least one shell deeply.** Surface-level knowledge of many shells is less valuable than deep expertise in one. Pick PowerShell or Bash and master its scripting, pipeline, and debugging capabilities.
- **Version control everything.** Not just source code — configuration files, infrastructure definitions, documentation, and scripts all belong in Git.
- **Use containers for reproducible environments.** Docker and Podman eliminate "works on my machine" problems by packaging applications with their exact dependencies.
- **Prefer declarative build runners.** Tools like Make, Just, and Task let you define project commands (build, test, lint, deploy) in a single file, making onboarding and CI/CD consistent.
