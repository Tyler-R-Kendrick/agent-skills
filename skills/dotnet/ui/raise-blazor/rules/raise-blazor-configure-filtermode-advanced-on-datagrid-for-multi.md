## Configure `FilterMode.Advanced` on DataGrid for multi-condition filtering

Configure `FilterMode.Advanced` on DataGrid for multi-condition filtering: and `FilterMode.Simple` for search-box-style filtering; Advanced mode generates proper OData filter expressions that can be passed directly to `LoadData` server queries without custom parsing.
