## Use the Content Pipeline (MGCB Editor) to preprocess all assets

(textures, audio, fonts, effects) into `.xnb` format at build time rather than loading raw files at runtime; the pipeline compresses textures into GPU-native formats and validates assets during the build, catching missing or corrupt files before deployment.
