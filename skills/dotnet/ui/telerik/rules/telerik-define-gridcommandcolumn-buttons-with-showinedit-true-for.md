## Define `<GridCommandColumn>` buttons with `ShowInEdit="true"` for Save/Cancel

Define `<GridCommandColumn>` buttons with `ShowInEdit="true"` for Save/Cancel: and without it for Edit/Delete, so that the correct button set appears based on whether the row is in read or edit mode; combining all four buttons without `ShowInEdit` flags shows all actions simultaneously.
