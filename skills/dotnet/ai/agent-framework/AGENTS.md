# Agent Framework

## Overview
Prefer Agent Framework for orchestration, tools, and multi-agent workflows.

## Example
```csharp
// Configure agents and tools at the host composition root.
// Inject agent clients into services that need them.
```

## Guidance
- Keep tool execution and model calls behind abstractions.
- Centralize policies, retries, and logging.
