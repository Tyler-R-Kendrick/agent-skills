  "description": "Guidance for System.IO.Abstractions file system abstraction library. USE FOR: wrapping file and directory operations for testability, mocking file system access in unit tests, replacing static File/Directory/Path calls with injectable interfaces, using MockFileSystem for deterministic test scenarios, testing code that reads/writes files. DO NOT USE FOR: actual file I/O performance optimization, replacing stream-based APIs, or scenarios where you need raw file system performance without abstraction overhead.",
