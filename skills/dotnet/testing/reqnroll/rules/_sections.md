| 2 | Use dependency injection for all step definition dependencies | CRITICAL | [`reqnroll-use-dependency-injection-for-all-step-definition.md`](reqnroll-use-dependency-injection-for-all-step-definition.md) |
| 3 | Share state between step classes via a scoped context object | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-share-state-between-step-classes-via-a-scoped-context-object.md`](reqnroll-share-state-between-step-classes-via-a-scoped-context-object.md) |
| 4 | Keep step definitions reusable across multiple features | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-keep-step-definitions-reusable-across-multiple-features.md`](reqnroll-keep-step-definitions-reusable-across-multiple-features.md) |
| 5 | Use `[StepArgumentTransformation]` for complex parameter types | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-use-stepargumenttransformation-for-complex-parameter-types.md`](reqnroll-use-stepargumenttransformation-for-complex-parameter-types.md) |
| 6 | Tag scenarios for selective execution and filtering | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-tag-scenarios-for-selective-execution-and-filtering.md`](reqnroll-tag-scenarios-for-selective-execution-and-filtering.md) |
| 7 | Organize feature files by business domain, not by implementation | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-organize-feature-files-by-business-domain-not-by.md`](reqnroll-organize-feature-files-by-business-domain-not-by.md) |
| 8 | Use Background blocks for shared Given steps within a feature | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-use-background-blocks-for-shared-given-steps-within-a.md`](reqnroll-use-background-blocks-for-shared-given-steps-within-a.md) |
| 9 | Limit each scenario to one When step for clarity | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-limit-each-scenario-to-one-when-step-for-clarity.md`](reqnroll-limit-each-scenario-to-one-when-step-for-clarity.md) |
| 10 | Migrate from SpecFlow to Reqnroll by changing NuGet packages | MEDIUM | [`reqnroll-migrate-from-specflow-to-reqnroll-by-changing-nuget-packages.md`](reqnroll-migrate-from-specflow-to-reqnroll-by-changing-nuget-packages.md) |
