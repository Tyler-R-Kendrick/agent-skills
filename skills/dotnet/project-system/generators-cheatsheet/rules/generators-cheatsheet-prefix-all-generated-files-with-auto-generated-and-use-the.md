## Prefix all generated files with `// <auto-generated/>` and use the `.g.cs` suffix

Prefix all generated files with `// <auto-generated/>` and use the `.g.cs` suffix: to signal to editors, analyzers, and code-coverage tools that the file is machine-generated and should be excluded from style checks.
