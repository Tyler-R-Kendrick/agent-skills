# TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework

## Overview
TOGAF is an enterprise architecture framework that provides a structured approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information technology architecture. It is maintained by The Open Group and is the most widely adopted enterprise architecture framework globally.

TOGAF's core is the **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** — an iterative cycle of phases that transforms business requirements into architecture deliverables.

## Architecture Development Method (ADM)

The ADM is an iterative, cyclic process of continuous architecture development. Each phase produces defined deliverables, is validated against requirements, and feeds into the next phase.

## Enterprise Continuum

The Enterprise Continuum classifies architecture and solution assets along a spectrum from generic to organization-specific.

```
Generic ◄──────────────────────────────────────► Specific

┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Foundation   │  Common      │  Industry    │ Organization │
│  Architecture │  Systems     │  Architecture│ -Specific    │
│               │  Architecture│              │ Architecture │
├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│  Foundation   │  Common      │  Industry    │ Organization │
│  Solutions    │  Systems     │  Solutions   │ -Specific    │
│               │  Solutions   │              │ Solutions    │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
  Architecture Continuum (top row)
  Solutions Continuum (bottom row)
```

- **Architecture Continuum:** Ranges from Foundation Architectures (e.g., TOGAF TRM) through Common Systems Architectures (e.g., III-RM) to Industry and Organization-Specific Architectures.
- **Solutions Continuum:** Ranges from Foundation Solutions (e.g., platforms, operating systems) through to Organization-Specific Solutions (e.g., custom applications).

## TOGAF Content Metamodel

The Content Metamodel defines a formal structure for architectural artifacts. It specifies the types of entities that make up an architecture and how they relate.

### Core Content Metamodel Entities

| Entity | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Actor** | Business | A person, organization, or system that performs behavior |
| **Role** | Business | Responsibility or part played by an actor |
| **Business Service** | Business | Supports business capabilities, exposed via interfaces |
| **Business Process** | Business | Ordered set of activities producing a defined outcome |
| **Data Entity** | Data | An encapsulation of data recognized by a business domain expert |
| **Logical Data Component** | Data | A boundary grouping of related data entities |
| **Application Component** | Application | An encapsulation of application functionality |
| **Logical Application Component** | Application | A conceptual grouping of application functionality |
| **Technology Component** | Technology | A technology building block (hardware, infrastructure, middleware) |
| **Platform Service** | Technology | A technical capability required to support application components |

### Key Metamodel Relationships

```
Actor ──performs──► Role
Role ──participates-in──► Business Process
Business Process ──produces──► Business Service
Business Service ──is-realized-by──► Logical Application Component
Logical Application Component ──is-implemented-by──► Application Component
Application Component ──is-hosted-on──► Technology Component
Data Entity ──is-accessed-by──► Logical Application Component
```

### Extensions to the Core Metamodel
TOGAF defines optional extensions:
- **Governance Extensions:** Architecture Contract, Standard, Principle
- **Services Extensions:** Information System Service, Platform Service
- **Process/Event Extensions:** Event, Control, Product
- **Data Extensions:** Physical Data Component, Data Entity relationships
- **Infrastructure Consolidation Extensions:** Physical Technology Component, Location

## Key Deliverables Summary

|-------|---------------------|
| Preliminary | Tailored Architecture Framework, Principles |
| A - Vision | Architecture Vision, Statement of Architecture Work |
| B - Business | Business Architecture document, Gap analysis |
| C - Info Systems | Data Architecture, Application Architecture, Gap analysis |
| D - Technology | Technology Architecture, Standards catalog, Gap analysis |
| E - Opportunities | Architecture Roadmap, Transition Architectures |
| F - Migration | Implementation and Migration Plan |
| G - Governance | Architecture Contract, Compliance assessments |
| H - Change Mgmt | Change requests, Updated requirements |
| Requirements Mgmt | Architecture Requirements Specification (continuous) |

## Best Practices
- **Iterate, don't waterfall.** The ADM is explicitly iterative. Complete a lightweight pass through all phases before deep-diving into any single phase.
- **Tailor the ADM.** TOGAF is a framework, not a methodology. Adapt the depth and formality of each phase to your organization's maturity and project scope.
- **Maintain the Architecture Repository.** Treat architecture outputs as living assets. Keep the repository current with baseline and target descriptions.
- **Use the Enterprise Continuum.** Classify reusable architecture assets along the continuum so teams can find and leverage existing patterns before inventing new ones.
- **Align with ArchiMate for notation.** TOGAF defines what to produce; ArchiMate defines how to model it visually. Use ArchiMate as the modeling language for TOGAF deliverables.
- **Engage stakeholders early.** Phase A exists specifically to secure buy-in. Do not skip stakeholder identification and concern mapping.
- **Define Architecture Principles before modeling.** Principles in the Preliminary Phase guide all subsequent architecture decisions and serve as tie-breakers.
- **Trace requirements continuously.** Requirements Management is not a phase you pass through once — it runs throughout every ADM cycle.
- **Use gap analysis rigorously.** In Phases B, C, and D, the gap between baseline and target drives the roadmap in Phase E. Incomplete gap analysis leads to incomplete migration plans.
- **Govern the implementation.** Phase G ensures that the actual implementation conforms to the architecture. Without governance, architectures become shelfware.
