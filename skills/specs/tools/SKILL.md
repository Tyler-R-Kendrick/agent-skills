    Use when working with specification tooling that automates the spec-driven development workflow — from generating specs to creating plans and tasks from specifications.
    USE FOR: spec-driven development tooling, spec-to-code automation, specification management tools, choosing spec tools
    DO NOT USE FOR: writing specifications manually (use documentation sub-skills), creating diagrams (use diagramming sub-skills)

# Specification Tools

## Overview
Specification tools automate the workflow from written specs to implementation. They bridge the gap between documentation and code by generating plans, tasks, and implementations from structured specifications.

## Tool Landscape

| Tool | Purpose | Integration |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **GitHub Spec Kit** | Spec-driven development with AI agents | Claude, Copilot, Cursor |

## Best Practices
- Use spec tools to enforce a structured workflow — constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → implement.
- Keep generated specs in version control alongside your code.
- Treat spec tooling as a development accelerator, not a replacement for architectural thinking.
